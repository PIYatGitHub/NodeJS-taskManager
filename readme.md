<em> Created by Peter Y during the following course: <a href ="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/">
NodeJS Mastery</a> as supervised by Mr. Andrew J. Mead </em>

## Getting started for users
This app supports full user auth

## Getting started for devs
All the standard moves like ``npm install`` are highly recommended.
There is a config file, which is not committed and
holds some data needed for the app to run. Such data
is the jwt signature key, so you need to make such file yourself. 
Recommended location is: ``src/utils/config.js``.
